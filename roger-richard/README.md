# Project Name

**Author**: Roger Davenport and Richard Montgomery
**Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
The Overview of today's lab was to use SQL to join data from two tables and insert author information to post and to put into the database.

## Getting Started
We installed our node modules and edited the conString when alternating between platforms. We joined data from two tables, worked on a function that would create a new article by using the author_id from our database, and another that would update the article by the author_id in both the articles table and the authors table.

## Architecture
JavaScript and SQL

## Change Log
12-08-2017 2:00pm Updated server.js to utilize two tables to append and update content to the front-end.

## Credits and Collaborations
Richard/Roger and a huge thank you to Kat and classmates.
